// branching ---- allows you to develop new features while preserving original Master. allows you to work on multiple features exclusive of each other

			-----feature A 
-----master
			-----feature B

either A or B, can drop or merge to become the official timeline (like marvel universe) 

git branch [NAME]
	creates new branch where [NAME] is name of branch

git branch 
	lists the existing branches in repository. branch with * and in green is in focus.

git checkout [NAME]
	switches you to branch [NAME], or master, which is original.

git merge [BRANCH NAME]
	merges [BRANCH NAME] into the branch you are currently in.
	
// if thre are clashes between branches, i.e., on same line, you will need to manually fix it yourself


git checkout [COMMIT ID]
	brings you back in time to the commit-id

git revert --no-edit [COMMIT-ID]
	reverses [COMMIT-ID] commit by making another commit.

git reset hard
	ohshit button, destroys all your changes. Useful if you get lost in time (i.e., made changes in another commit-id and not allowed to go back to master)
